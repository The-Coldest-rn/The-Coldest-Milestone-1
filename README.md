## Overview
### Description
The Coldest presents an online marketplace which allows consumers to find local businesses, as well as allows those businesses to directly interact with their consumers for fast and efficient business transactions. This application will replicate the idea of a mall but digitally, where you can shop multiple stores all in one central location.

### App Evaluation 
- Category: E-commerce / Marketplace
- Story: Provides users with an easy and convenient method of shopping for all their needs at the touch of a button.
- Market: Any individual can use this application, the app is purposely broad enough to interest anyone who enjoys shopping.
- Habit: This application can be seen being used daily or at a consumer's leisure much like shopping in a traditional brick-and-mortar shopping mall.
- Scope: First we will discuss what variety of stores are in demand currently, and then we'll refine that list depending on the demand in that local area. The application will report frequently in order to keep up with local trends.
